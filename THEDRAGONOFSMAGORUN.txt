						kids out of their beds while they were sleeping, and he would drop them
						down his green tortoise throat. Now back in those days all the kids would
						sit in his stomach and cry, 'Let us out, Let us out!!' Of course he would not
						let them out, but sometimes a brave little soul would travel the long journey
						till he plopped out the other end.";

						Text "BARTENDER: Now there was a little girl named Susie who had heard about this evil
						dragon, and wanted to see for herself that he was real. So one night she
						crawled under her sister's bed waiting for the dragon to pick her up. The
						dragon came slowly and silently through the city, getting ready to pick up
						his midnight snack. When Susie saw her she was amazed at how ugly he
						was, his mouth was dripping with drool ready to pick a kid. He then picked
						up Susie's sister with Susie hanging on to her back. Right before she was
						going to be dropped in the pot of doom, she jumped swiftly on to the
						dragons head. She felt the slimy texture of the dragon’s skin on her cold
						bare toes, she waited until the dragon was ready to go, and then she
						clenched his smelly ear as tight as she could so that she wouldn't go flying
						off his head. Then she experienced something no one else had ever
						experienced before, she was flying! She felt the cold winter breeze hitting
						her face as they flew over her city.'There is my house,' she called with her
						tiny sliver of a voice. She then looked behind her seeing how big the
						dragon actually was and how small she was. She looked up at the night sky
						and closed her eyes, drifting into a deep sleep.

						her eyes open, afraid of what she was going to see, she saw multiple
						dragons surrounding the dragon that she was standing on. The dragons
						were making strange sounds in dragon language, yelling at the dragon that
						seemed smaller than the rest. Susie looked down at the dragons eyes
						seeing floods of tears streaming down its face, it was crying. She didn't see
						why they were doing this, this dragon was huge to her, but small to them.
						Then she understood, the dragon was lonely. After what felt like hours, the
						little dragon scooted its way out of the circle moving back to its cave. Then
						she saw the most ugly thing she had ever seen: trash, rubbish, mud
						everywhere, and anything you could think of that was disgusting. She 
						smelled in the stench and she thought she was going to throw up. As they
						walked back to his cave Susie could feel the dragon moping around. She
						felt so bad for him, eating all the little children so his sorrows would go
						away. Then she called out as loud as she could in to the dragon’s ear:";

						dragon heard this, his yellow eyes peered up at Susie having the sense of

						stare until the dragon picked her up with his creepy long claws and was
						about to drop her in to his mouth, but he had missed his chance because
						Susie had fainted.";

						Text "BARTENDER: 'I'm all right Mr. Dragon.' Susie said. The dragon stopped sobbing
