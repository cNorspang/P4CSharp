					down his green tortoise throat. Now back in those days all the kids would
					sit in his stomach and cry, 'Let us out, Let us out!!' Of course he would not

					till he plopped out the other end.";

					dragon, and wanted to see for herself that he was real. So one night she
					crawled under her sister's bed waiting for the dragon to pick her up. The
					dragon came slowly and silently through the city, getting ready to pick up
					his midnight snack. When Susie saw her she was amazed at how ugly he
					was, his mouth was dripping with drool ready to pick a kid. He then picked
					up Susie's sister with Susie hanging on to her back. Right before she was
					going to be dropped in the pot of doom, she jumped swiftly on to the
					dragons head. She felt the slimy texture of the dragon’s skin on her cold
					bare toes, she waited until the dragon was ready to go, and then she
					clenched his smelly ear as tight as she could so that she wouldn't go flying
					off his head. Then she experienced something no one else had ever
					experienced before, she was flying! She felt the cold winter breeze hitting
					her face as they flew over her city.'There is my house,' she called with her
					tiny sliver of a voice. She then looked behind her seeing how big the
					dragon actually was and how small she was. She looked up at the night sky
					and closed her eyes, drifting into a deep sleep.

					As she peeked her eyes open, afraid of what she was going to see, she saw 
					multiple dragons surrounding the dragon that she was standing on. The dragons
					were making strange sounds in dragon language, yelling at the dragon that
					seemed smaller than the rest. Susie looked down at the dragons eyes
					seeing floods of tears streaming down its face, it was crying. She didn't see
					why they were doing this, this dragon was huge to her, but small to them.
					Then she understood, the dragon was lonely. After what felt like hours, the
					little dragon scooted its way out of the circle moving back to its cave. Then
					she saw the most ugly thing she had ever seen: trash, rubbish, mud
					everywhere, and anything you could think of that was disgusting. She 
					smelled in the stench and she thought she was going to throw up. As they
					walked back to his cave Susie could feel the dragon moping around. She
					felt so bad for him, eating all the little children so his sorrows would go
					away. Then she called out as loud as she could in to the dragon’s ear:";

					about to drop her in to his mouth, but he had missed his chance because
					Susie had fainted.";
